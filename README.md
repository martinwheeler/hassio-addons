# Home Assistant Add-ons

## About

These are a collection of add-ons for Home Assistant that I've either built myself or modified
from another source to serve my needs. Add-ons found here are typically born out
of my own needs, but I publish them here in case anyone else finds them useful. These are
available for use **at your own risk**. I try my best to ensure everything works,
but there are no guarantees of support, functionality, or that they will be free
of bugs, even catastrophic ones.

## Installation

Add the repository url listed below to your Supervisor Add-on Store tab in Home
Assistant.
